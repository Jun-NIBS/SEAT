Team 41 Epilepsy Modeling: Meeting Minutes

* 8/28/15
[Currell] 
Today Johnny, Michael, and I worked together during the free class period. 

Johnny set up github for us.
Michael and I discussed/worked with MNE python and EEGLAB.
I worked on the document eeglab_usage.org, which explains how to do the simple EEGLAB tasks.
