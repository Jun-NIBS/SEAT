[CB 12/8/2015]

This directory is intended to contain external binaries which are used to build the SEAT installer.  As these binaries are large, we do not check them into version control.  Rather, you must run

    make getDeps

from within this directory in order to pull down the dependencies.

The primary dependency is miniconda.
